# Grammar correction with Neural network

Using Neural Machine Translation for Grammar Correction.

Description comming soon :)


###TODO:
  - Use fasttext because it has information about the underlying morphology of words and was empirically found to perform better than initializing
  the network randomly or using word2vec.
  
  - Use character ngram feature
  
  - Use Keras Tokenizer and sequence padding
